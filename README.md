**ANIMAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM**


`OVERVIEW`


This code organizes animals into categories using basic object-oriented programming concepts. It helps classify animals based on whether they are cold-blooded, have a backbone, and their specific type.

`CLASSES`

1. **ANIMAL**
   
- Represents a general animal with common properties.

`Properties:`

**type:** The type of the animal.

**coldBlooded:** Indicates if the animal is cold-blooded.

**hasBackbone:** Indicates if the animal has a backbone.

`Methods:`


**getType():** Returns the type of the animal.

**isColdBlooded():** Checks if the animal is cold-blooded.

**isBackbone():** Checks if the animal has a backbone.

2. **ARTHROPODA, FISH, AMPHIBIAN, REPTILE, BIRD, MAMMAL**

   
- Specific animal classes that inherit from Animal.

- Characteristics are set through constructors.
4. **CAT, EAGLE**
  
- Specialized classes inheriting characteristics from mammals and birds, respectively.

  
**`EXAMPLE USAGE`**


*// Create an array of various animal instances*

*const animals = [*

  *new Arthropod(),*
  
  *new Fish(),*
  
  *new Amphibian(),*
  
  *new Reptile(),*
  
  *new Bird(),*
  
  *new Mammal(),*
  
  *new Cat(),*
  
  *new Eagle(),*
*];*

*// Display information about each animal*

*animals.forEach((animal) => {*

  *const bloodType = animal.isColdBlooded() ? "Cold-blooded" : "Warm-blooded";*
  
  *const boneType = animal.isBackbone() ? "Backbone" : "No Backbone";*
  
  console.log(`${animal.getType()} - ${bloodType}`);
  
  console.log(`${animal.getType()} - ${boneType}`);
});
